        <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> How it all started</h2>
        <p>I was once a teacher with <a href="https://indonesiamengajar.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><emp>Indonesia Mengajar</emp></a>,
          a program that sends young people to teach in remote villages in Indonesia for a year. The program was featured
          in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/30/world/asia/taking-big-city-skills-to-indonesias-villages.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> a few years back.
        </p>
        <p>I was assigned to teach in Rote Island, of East Nusa Tenggara province with 8 other young people,
          each living and teaching in a different village.
          The village I lived in was only 30 minutes away from the town, but the island had little public
          transportation. Initially, I often relied on others to take me to places on a motorbike. Then I
          decided that it was imperative for me to be able to ride a motorbike. And that's how it began.

          <h2><i class="fas fa-forward"></i> Adoption process</h2>
          <p> This is how I got my very first motorbike:</p>
          <ol>
              <li>Learn how to start a motorbike</li>
              <li>Test drive a friend's motorbike</li>
              <li>Ask a friend's friend to buy a used motorbike from the main island</li>
              <li>Have the motorbike transported on a ship to the village</li>
              <li>Go to town to apply for a driving license</li>
              <li>Ride the motorbike! Yippee!</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Except that this second-hand motorbike had some issues.</p>
          <p>When I told my friends that I was buying a motorbike, they were surprised.
            They were more surprised to know that I blindly trusted someone I didn't know to buy me the bike
            from another island. In Indonesia we had the expression, "Buying a cat in a bag", for things like this -
            which means that we don't know what we're buying.</p>
          <p>It turned out that it was a <strong>stray cat</strong>, or what we called <emp>"kucing garong"</emp>.</p>
          <p>Though troublesome as it was when I first got it, it brought me to a lot of <a href="adventure.html">adventures</a> - up and down
            a mountain, across the river, and on rocky roads. The stray cat proved to be a trusted and faithful companion.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><h5>My pastor</h5></li>
              <p>He took me one of the most difficult places to reach: the church. Our church was located
                in a village down the mountain and the road that went there was rocky and had sharp turns.
                I had my first motorcycle accident when going to the church. But I learned that if I could
                do such difficult road, I could do many other kinds of road.</p>
              <li><h5>My friend</h5></li>
              <p>He was the first to lend me his motorbike for me to 'abuse'. I wouldn't dare practicing
                with someone else's motorbike in fear of ruining it.</p>
              <li><h5>My fellow female teacher</h5></li>
              <p>She was my colleague at school, and one of my closest local friends in the island.
                She was also one of the coolest female riders. I learned from her that women can ride
                on the most difficult roads too.</p>
              <li><h5>My students</h5></li>
              <p>My students took pride in claiming that they taught me how to ride a motorbike.
              Some of the young boys really did know how to ride them. When I first got my motorbike,
              they would run besides me and literally instructing me when to switch gear and break.</p>
